# Welcome to Oneiric Research Group docs contributing guide

Thank you for joining our journey and helping us build on the bleeding edge of AI x NFTs x Gaming.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow for getting your artwork in the system

### Disclaimer

By contributing to this repository you provide Oneiric Research Group the ownership of any IP contributed to the project to use indefinitely. This includes code, discussions (ideas) and all types of artwork. While often designers and developers are rewarded with the NFTs and airdrops, there is no guarantee of reward. By submitting content, you agree to the terms of service of the Oneiric Research Group and these conditions.

You confirm that the artwork is original and completely your design. Copying others artwork can land yourself and the project in trouble.

## How can I help?

If you have a bright idea, open an issue or join our active Discord #artists-chat first and start a discussion. We love to bring in the community ideas where possible!

Don't have any ideas? We would suggest scanning the open issues and seeing if there is something that catches your eye.

If you are looking for something to work on, the team manages an open list of art requests on Github you can check out - https://github.com/Oneiric-Research-Group/FeatureDiscussions/labels/enhancement

## How do I submit the artwork?

To help organize what artwork the project needs, what is being voted on and what is accepted please upload your image as an attachment to the Github issue.

You will need to include:

- The raw asset - minified version (1px units) and an enlarged preview version
- A screenshot of the asset in the game
- Your wallet address (often used for airdropping assets to the winning designer)

A good example that includes the minified, enlarged and screenshot preview

## How does the art get accepted?

The team is exploring DAO mechanisms and voting rights for people with certain NFTs. Until we have this automated system, artwork is picked by community consensus in Discord and on the Github issue.
